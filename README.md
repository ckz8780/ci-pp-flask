# Welcome! 

This repo provides a simple demonstration of the Flask micro-framework for Python. It is part of the Practical Python module for CodeInstitute. It's been lightly modified from the original to show generic examples of rendering templates, for loops, reading files, template logic, etc.

#### Requirements:

- Python 3+
- Flask

#### Usage:

- Clone the repo or download/extract all files
- `pip3 install flask` (if you haven't installed flask)
- `cd [extracted files dir]`
- Open run.py and remove `host` and `port` parameters from `app.run()` function
- `python3 run.py `
- Navigate to http://localhost:5000

#### Live version:

There is also a live version at https://ckz8780-flask-demo.herokuapp.com (This is a free dyno and may go to sleep, so be patient on initial load!)
